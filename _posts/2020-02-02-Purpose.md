---

Balanced your English as a language learner. Learn and practice the important parts like talking to people.
This club is designed for internationals who wish to improve their communication skills in English.The content is for those  involved in 
academic programs in English but fluency is not requiered. In fact, we create fluency with creative engaging activities that help us think 
before we speak and visa-versa.  
<br/>
The speaking club seeks to build friendships by enabling participants to express themselved freely and to recognize their strengths and
needs through low fidelity chat.
In language learning, we seek to build fluency and confidence and to use English more effetively so that we can achieve our goals. It 
also seeks to develop the participants skills in independent learning outside of the classroom.
