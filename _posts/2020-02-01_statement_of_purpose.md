title: Extra Foot English's Purpose
---

We want to help get you more balanced as an English user and language learner.
This club is designed for internationals who wish to improve their communication skills in English.The content is for those  involved in 
academic programs in English but fluency is not requiered. In fact, we create fluency with creative engaging activities that help us think 
before we speak.  
The speaking group seeks to enable participants to express themselved freely and to recognize their strengths as well as their needs.
In language learning, we seek to build fluency and confidencee and to use English more effetively so that we can achieve our goals. It 
also seeks to develop the participants skills in independent learning outside of the classroom.
