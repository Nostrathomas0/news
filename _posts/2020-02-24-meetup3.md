Hello friends, Wednesday the 23rd, we have a special announcement. We'll be talking about language apps, Duolingo, HelloTalk, Babble ...
Most language learners use them for extra practice. They're useful but they also have their downsides.  
We're going to light a fire as usual and serve hot drinks. Please text to reserve a seat whatsapp +0534 839 5915.
