title: What is Phonology?
---

When you were a baby, you probably learned to talk from your parents so chances are, you speak a lot like them. If you learned a different language from the one you spoke as a child, or if you spoke 2 or more languages as a child, you had to make your tongue move differently from the way it naturally wants to move. 
#### How does phonology affect me?

All languages (save sign language) use the mouth. How many different sounds can it make? Well, American English has 24 consonant sounds /b tʃ d f g dʒ h ʒ k l m n ŋ p r s ʃ t θ ð v w j z/ and vowels /ɪ	i		ʊ	u	eɪ[c]	ə
(ɜ)[d]		oʊ[c]	ɛ		ʌ[d]	(ɔ)[e]/
Open	æ				ɑ
Diphthongs	aɪ   ɔɪ   aʊ Speaking a new language is like switching from Python to C, or Street Fighter to Mortal Kombat, or Football to Hockey. You've simply got to practice it to learn it.
