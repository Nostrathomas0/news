Dear friends, we can't keep meeting like this. I think it's time we stay home, get some reading done, reassess our plan, consider what led us to this point
and just ride this out for a month or a year, or whatever it takes. Maybe you're going home. Maybe you've already gone home. Anyways
this was a lot of fun for me. I feel like I've started something which will be reborn again and again like a phoenix.
 -hope to meet again, much love and best wishes, Tom
